# README Generator Project

## Description

In this project we were instructed with creating a README through the command line using Node.js. This assignment had us implement a fs.writeFile in order to generate the README file directly from the command line based on questions asked to get user input. We also had to implement badges using shield.io as the acceptance criteria suggested.
